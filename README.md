# Hi there, I'm Raghad ðŸŒŸ 

I am a mathematician and a data scientist, with a passion for understanding complex systems and telling meaningful stories hidden within data. My journey is shaped by a deep desire to demystify math for others, making it more accessible and engaging. My mission is to empower learners, challenge assumptions, and contribute to research that bridges the gap between brain research and machine learning.

Behind the data is a story, and I want to tell that story.

## Featured Projects
- [**Toronto Traffic Collisions EDA Project**](https://github.com/raghadkibrahim/toronto-collisions-eda)  
       Analyzed traffic collisions to gain insights into collision trends, identify potential hotspots, and explore temporal and spatial patterns to better understand road safety issues in Toronto.

- [**My Chess Games Time-Series Analysis**](https://github.com/raghadkibrahim/my_chess_games)  
         Analyzed historical chess games data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights over time. By converting .pgn files into structured data, key metrics such as win rate, rating progression, game frequency, and opening preferences are tracked. Time-series techniques, including rolling averages and seasonal decomposition, help identify performance trends and periodic fluctuations.
